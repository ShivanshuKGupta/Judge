# Submission Checker

## Pre-requisites

1. python and npm

## How to use?

1. Clone the repo.
2. Make a new folder like the folder 'Lab2' which already exists.
3. Make two new subfolders: submissions and sample_input
4. Then finally run the main.py file.

## What it does?

1. It first asks you the location of the folder where the sub-folders were created.
2. Then for every file in submissions, it compiles it and runs it against every input file present in the folder sample_input.
3. And stores the output a new folder saved_output (will be present in the same folder).
4. Finally, runs dolos on the submission files
